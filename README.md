# Sentiment-Analysis
What is the perception of people towards work from home based on their tweets?

Covid-19 pandemic has engulfed the world in a lot of problems and new changes have come up due to the existing problems at hand. Employees expressed conflicting emotions towards working from home as all the offices were closed due to the lockdown [1]. As a result of government mandates during the pandemic, people had to stick to remote work which means a sort of arrangement where people carry out their job responsibilities from the place where they live [2]. Here I will be analyzing the sentiments of working people towards working from home in the corona virus pandemic using data scraped from twitter. After scraping the data based on different keywords, I used Vader python package to do the sentiment analysis on the tweets scraped. This will give me positive, negative, and neutral tweets which I can use as labels for model training. I used word embedding techniques like Sentence Bert to train the model with their respective labels obtained in the previous step and predict on some new tweets to find out the performance of the model.
